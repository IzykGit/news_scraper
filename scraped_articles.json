        "content": "Could election change protection US offers Europe?\n19 hours ago\nShare\nSave\nJonathan Beale\nDefence correspondent\nMOD\nA US carrier strike group - a major fleet of warships - is a potent symbol of American military power and a signal that it's willing to defend allies and deter enemies.\nSo the presence of such a force in the North Sea over the past few weeks is meant to reassure European allies, despite the political uncertainties back home.\nAmerican military power has helped protect Europe for the past 75 years - but the US presidential election raises the question: for how much longer?\nMilitary commanders do their best to avoid politics.\nBut among a group of journalists invited on board the USS Harry S Truman, the US presidential race was high on the agenda. The question was: will America still have Europe's back?\nRear Adm Sean Bailey said: \"What I can tell you is we are firmly committed to our alliance, firmly committed to Nato.\"\nReuters\nBut he's not the one who will be deciding US foreign policy, and nor is his answer likely to assuage doubts.\nGermany's Defence Minister, Boris Pistorius, knows change is in the air.\nAsked about the likely impact of the US election on Europe last week, he said it was a question of whether America does \"a lot less, or a little bit less\".\nHe didn't mention names, but it's Donald Trump who's likely to do a lot less.\nUSS Harry S Truman proudly bears the name of the president who helped establish Nato 75 years ago.\nBut a second Trump term could once again shake the alliance to its very core.\nThe Truman doctrine of giving military, economic and political support to democratic nations under threat is very different to Trump's policy of America First.\nHe recently said Russia can \"do whatever the hell they want\" to allies who don't spend enough on defence.\nMOD\nAny US withdrawal from Europe would leave a large hole.\nThe USS Harry S Truman is proof of what America brings in sheer size and numbers - with 5,000 crew and more than 60 aircraft.\nThe Royal Navy's carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, sailing nearby, provided a reminder of Europe's more modest defences.\nThe British carrier was sailing with an air wing of a few helicopters and eight F-35 jets - a pale reflection of US military clout.\nHow the election could change the world\nUS allies try to 'Trump-proof' Nato\nWhat is Nato and which countries are members?\nOverall the US has more than 100,000 military personnel deployed in Europe.\nLast time he was president, Trump threatened to withdraw some of those forces. If elected he could do the same again.\nMany Republicans believe Europe should look after itself. That's certainly the view of Elbridge Colby, a senior Pentagon official in the last Trump administration.\nHe says the US should \"withhold\" its forces from Europe to focus on the threat posed by China.\nThe election will also have an impact on US military aid to Ukraine - America is by far its biggest military backer.\nBut a senior Nato official, who did not want to be named, recently told the BBC \"regardless of who wins the share of America's contribution to Ukraine will probably decrease in relative terms\".\nEurope, he said, can't expect the US to continue giving an \"outsized\" contribution.\nThe reality is that America's military focus has already been shifting east to the Indo-Pacific region and the rise of China.\nThe Pentagon identifies China as its greatest security challenge. China now has a larger navy than the US. It's building a fleet the size of the entire Royal Navy every two years.\nThe sailors and pilots on board the carrier recognise there's a pivot east too.\nCdr Bernie Lutz has spent much of his naval career flying F-18s off a US carrier in the Pacific and Middle East.\nHe recognises why they're now sailing in European waters. \"There's a lot going on,\" he says.\nBut he adds, \"I think the Pacific theatre is the bigger, overarching long-term goal\".\nLike the rest of the 5,000-strong crew of the carrier, he has not yet been told where they'll be sailing next - but it's been widely reported that the USS Harry S Truman will soon be on its way to the Middle East.\nThat region, too, will remain a challenge for whoever's president next.\nCapt Dave Snowden says he's happy to carry the banner of de-escalation or deterrence or even sail into harm's way - wherever the carrier's sent.\nBut the lack of serious foreign policy debate in the election reflects a reluctance to get directly involved in more wars.\nAmerica will still remain the world's most pre-eminent military power.\nThe question is how will the next president use it.\nMore on this story\nWhat the US election outcome means for Ukraine, Gaza and world conflict\nWhat is Nato and which countries are members?\nUS election weighs on Ukraine's frontline soldiers\nUS allies try to 'Trump-proof' Nato - but is that even possible?\nRoyal Navy\nUS election 2024\nUS Armed Forces\nNato\nUnited States",
